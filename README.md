# hello-world

Greetings from the Sierra Madre Oriental


Living in a small apartment in the heart of a 10 million inhabitant city in a valley surrounded by deserts, I write. I write about mostly anything, mostly fiction. Also ghostwriting. Also, I make lists about little things I find on the ground everywhere: bugs, pieces of paper, small objects, flowers, and mostly trash.

I'm interested in learning. Learning many things. Learning everyday. 

I came here by accident.
